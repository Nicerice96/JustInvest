# Overview

In this problem, we had to develop a regestration system where we could register as the various roles (and permissions) described in earlier versions of the justInvest system.  The users are still saved to `passwd.txt` and each role still includes all the permissions from the previous iterations of the system. That is, we are just building on previous versions. 

# How To Run

Running the main.py will lead you to a rudamentary UI that I used to test the system during development

For a more comprehensive testing of the system the test.py was added later to test the functionality of this iteration of the project. It ensures that all Registration functions work!

This is probably not useful to you, but you can run it if you want:
```bash
python3 main.py 
```
Test suite:
```bash
python3 test.py
```
